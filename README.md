# Pydantic - code samples

Supplemental material for presentation about the **pydantic** Python package.

## Trying out examples

1. Make sure to have python installed on your machine (if want to run locally)
2. Create a virtual environment. For your specific system, follow the instructions [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/creating-python-virtual-environment-windows-linux/).
3. In the root of the project, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Go to your desired example (e.g. `cd square_area`).
5. Run the example using `python <file_name>.py` (e.g. `python with_pydantic.py`)
