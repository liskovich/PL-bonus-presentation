## Prompts (OpenAI)

- Give me some python code for square area calculation which is not safe and does not use Pydantic, and then alternative version of safe code that uses Pydantic.
- Tell me the differences, pros and cons of both static and dynamic typing languages. Give me some examples for both.
- Write me a pydantic model for Dish, which contains name, description and some other fields (add what you think are appropriate), and add a model that would represent a list of these dishes.
